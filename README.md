# Exercise to crack provided encrypted file.

This is a small excercise to read the provided encrypted file, 
having access to the obfuscated code that generated it. It's 
a pretty simple task. 

```
    src/ - the horrible, horrible source code.
    exercise/ - the exercise files. 
    solution/ - A solution for how to do it in IntelliJ.
```
